_**The global strategy is to have 1,000+ nodes operating globally on the network by 2025.**_

#### Key stakeholders are:

* **Existing Customers**

Over 50 exchanges are ready to engage with the beta launch of OpenDAX™ v4 with the native Yellow Network integration immediately.

* **FinTech Entrepreneurs**

Those interested in opening an exchange. Our new solution fits every budget and is radically more simple than a standard centralized exchange.

* **Financial Institutions**

Co-invest with us and show interest in selling their services through Yellow Network; they bring a deal flow of their incubates.

* **Crypto-Enthusiasts, Miners & Traders**

Can quickly deploy our node software on any cloud and start liquidity-mining with their exchange account.

#### Token Usage[​](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/yellow-token#token-usage) <a href="#_kw1brkre74t9" id="_kw1brkre74t9"></a>

$YELLOW tokens are locked to be able to open trading channels with other brokers.

The node software is open-source; however, you need to lock $YELLOW tokens to become an exchange broker in Yellow Network.

**Access shared liquidity**

* Launch an application on supported hardware and give it a name.
* Lock 250,000 YELLOW tokens to activate 4 peer-to-peer trading channels.
* Stake collateral to be able to exchange between brokers.
