## What is the cost to join the Yellow Network?&#x20;

#### A. Joining the Network

There are two ways to join the Yellow Network.

* By using our Opendax v4 Exchange software.
* By connecting your own exchange engine through Yellow Network's API.

Both of those solutions can have direct access to the Yellow Network.

To be included in the Yellow Network, the exchange will need to have and stack at a minimum amount of 250.000 Yellow Tokens ($YT), which will allow the creation of 4 peer-to-peer trading channels and access to their liquidity pool.

Sample bellow:&#x20;

| Yellow Token stacked | Opened state channels |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| 250.000              | 4                     |
| 500.000              | 8                     |
| 1.000.000            | 12                    |

#### D. Trading fees

The system are collecting fees for each trade executed using the network.

The fees will be split in the following way&#x20;

* 15% for the clearinghouse;
* 15% converted into Yellow Token to burned;
* 70% will got to the brokers / market-makers;

#### Why burning tokens? (internal note = to be included in the trading fees part)

The main reason to burn tokens is to create a deflationary currency.

By reducing the supply we ensure that the token can be an effective store of value.

Additionally, by reducing the circulating supply of a portion of the circulation of a cryptocurrency the number of transactions gets equally reduced. In a nutshell, a reduction in volume lowers the chances of spam attacks which leaves enough bandwidth for health transaction count on the network.
