## What is the cost to join the Yellow Network?&#x20;

#### A. Joining the Network

There are two ways to join Yellow Network.

* By using our OpenDAX v4 Exchange software.
* By connecting your own exchange engine through Yellow Network's API.

Both of those solutions can have direct access to the Yellow Network.

To be included in Yellow Network, the exchange will need to have and stack a minimum amount of 250,000 $YELLOW tokens, which will allow the creation of 4 peer-to-peer trading channels and access to their liquidity pool.

Sample bellow:&#x20;

| $YELLOW token stacked | Opened state channels |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 250.000               | 4                     |
| 500.000               | 8                     |
| 1.000.000             | 16                    |

#### B. The collateral

Each broker has to stack collateral in order to create a trustable relationship between the entities (Liquidity Provider) and avoid any dispute.

We define two main layers of collateral, held in separate wallets;

1\) Access Collateral:&#x20;

This represents a consistent minimum balance of $YELLOW tokens to be held as outlined under A which defines the number of open state channels the broker can access.&#x20;

2\) Operating collateral:

The operating collateral is in addition to the access collateral and will be used to settle market taker and market maker fees on an ongoing basis. The collateral ensures that the broker is able to pay each LP the rewards due when during the clearing process.

Market Maker Fees; collateral account receives liquidity provider rewards that increase the collateral

Market Taker Fees; collateral account pays rewards to liquidity providers (LP), which reduce the collateral on hold in the wallet

The separation of collateral wallets ensures transparency and facilitates accounting and state channel tiering.

Additional collateral layers, such as collateral for margin trading, will be introduced at a later stage.

#### C. OpenDAX v4 Licence

Basically, using Opendax v4 Exchange Software is 100% free of charge if you do not join the Yellow Network [(Point A)](economics.md#a.-joining-the-network).&#x20;

By using it without connection, the trades and orders made passing by your exchange will still**—**and be executed**—**into your own liquidity.

#### D. Marker fees

The system are collecting fees for each trade executed using the network.

The fees will be split in the following way&#x20;

* 15% for the clearing house;
* 15% converted into $YELLOW token to burned;
* 70% will go to the brokers / market-makers;

#### Why burning tokens? (internal note = to be included in the trading fees part)

The main reason to burn tokens is to create a deflationary currency.

By reducing the supply we ensure that the token can be an effective store of value.

Additionally, by reducing the circulating supply of a portion of the circulation of a cryptocurrency the number of transactions gets equally reduced. In a nutshell, a reduction in volume lowers the chances of spam attacks which leaves enough bandwidth for health transaction count on the network.
