#### Lessons from Traditional Finance[​](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/market#lessons-from-traditional-finance) <a href="#_ywlzf7jxtue3" id="_ywlzf7jxtue3"></a>

To overgrow The Wall Street, crypto should use and reimagine the competitor’s strengths.

#### Yellow Revenue[​](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/business-model#yellow-revenue) <a href="#_7mj450yypr6m" id="_7mj450yypr6m"></a>

We actively develop the technology stack around Yellow Network, as well as provide network participants with additional products and services to grow their businesses and the network itself.

This B2B2C business model gives us a variety of revenue streams to sustain operations, marketing, and R\&D:

1. **Sale of tokens**;
2. **Referral from partners.** We are connecting incoming leads (brokers/startups) with our network of partners for customization, and integrations, taking a referral share from the profits they gain;
3. **Integrations.** We work to improve the tech tack from our R\&D funds, but some of the integrations will be provided on a paid basis.
4. **Consultations.** Our organization helps companies/entrepreneurs jumpstart their business, connecting institutions, and partners.
5. **Plugin Marketplace.** Some of the plugins require an additional license, especially those where we cooperate with partners outside of Yellow.
6. **Profits from investments.** Yellow Incubator helps companies launch and scale, covering $YELLOW token costs from the community funds (non-profit). Also, we will provide additional services and mentorship in exchange for equity in promising startups.
