#### **Delegate liquidity to brokers**

Investors can delegate their tokens to a broker and take a revenue share of the trading fees of the broker.

Those who got tokens in private B or public sell - they can delegate their tokens to a broker and get access to the revenue share of the trading fees of the broker, while participating in the growth of this broker.

#### **Example 2**

Alice has purchased 50,000 YELLOW tokens.

Bob wants to open his own exchange platform and open a trade channel with other brokers to access liquidity.

Bob has only 200,000 Yellow tokens and is missing 50,000 YELLOW tokens to be able to open a trade channel.

Alice safely delegates her 50,000 YELLOW tokens to Bob, who is now able to open 4 trade channels.

Bob starts running a profitable exchange platform, with liquidity shared by the yellow network.

Alice receives ⅕ of all revenue received by Bob’s exchange platform in the form of Yellow Tokens.

#### **Liquidity mining**
