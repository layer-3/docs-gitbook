#### **Delegate liquidity to brokers**

Investors can delegate their tokens to a broker and take a revenue share of the trading fees of the broker.

Those who got tokens in private B or Public allocation can delegate their tokens to a Broker and get access to the revenue share of the trading fees of the broker, while participating in the growth of this Broker.

#### **Example:**

Alice has purchased 50,000 $YELLOW tokens.

Bob wants to open his own exchange platform and open a trade channel with other brokers to access liquidity.

Bob has only 200,000 $YELLOW tokens and is missing 50,000 $YELLOW tokens to be able to open a trade channel.

Alice safely delegates her 50,000 $YELLOW tokens to Bob, who is now able to open 4 trade channels.

Bob starts running a profitable exchange platform, with liquidity shared by Yellow Network.

Alice receives ⅕ of all revenue received by Bob’s exchange platform in the form of Yellow tokens.

#### **Liquidity Mining**

Power OpenDAX™ and deposit liquidity, bot trading, matching service (without user onboarding).

Crypto enthusiasts and active exchange platform customers can install a liquidity mining application and provide liquidity to Yellow Network, earning revenue from trading fees, making it a loyalty token program to keep tokens in your wallet and gain benefits from it.

#### **B2B services**

$YELLOW tokens will also be used by businesses to get services on [yellow.org](http://yellow.org/).
