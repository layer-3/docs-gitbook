* How do you plan to constantly increase the amount of Brokers during the following years?
  * We currently have brokers in the alpha testing of the network. Every Month we have 160 new customer inquiries for creating their brokerage. Also we have about 20 partner distributors which have their own stream of customers. They install the appliance for them which is activated when they stake enough YELLOW tokens.
* How do you plan sharing revenues with your Yellow network users? Where do fees go?
  * To collect fees you must run a Yellow node and mine trades by one way or the other. Also you can create liquidity channels, and charge for the usage (traffic using it). This means your collateral on this state-channel is used to connect the network to reach more liquidity, thus collecting a fee from volume on it.
* What is your way of calculating the Projected market cap?
  * We took 20x annual revenues of all connected Brokers. It was done according the NASDAQ algorithm. For the crypto industry it’s common to get 40x…100x revenues, but it is very optimistic for sure.
* How network combined revenue is calculated? What hypothetical values for trading fees?
  * Revenue of all brokers of the network, Trading fees we use range from 0.1 to 0.15%
* Is the main effect network-wise from the HFT trading just efficient pricing of assets across the yellow network, due to the efficient arbitrage among trading pairs in state channels quickly propagating around the mesh network?
  * Absolutely HFT and arbitrage tighten the spreads and increase liquidity availability. Arbitrage is about connecting asset availability world-wide hence creating a large and dynamic pool.
* Are there other benefits from the HFT capability from a retail (non-HFT trader) perspective?
  * HFT allows retail traders to profit from even very small price fluctuations and allows institutions to gain significant returns on bid-ask spreads across the network points such as CEX, DEX, CHAINS.
* To get market makers onboard, there would have to be sufficient liquidity turnover. Can you share the current funnel for end-user demand, and plans to grow it with the launch of the Yellow token and mesh network?
  * As we are Market-Makers ourselves, we know well the traction here; Market-Makers follow their customer requirements, as long as we offer access to additional and exclusive retail trader volume, their customers will request their market-makers to connect to Yellow Network.
  * Additionally we have focused our token sale efforts on onboarding tier one Market-makers at the seed stage.
* It sounds like Yellow’s user growth will come organically from the user bases of existing brokers and CEXs that join the Yellow network. Clarifying as crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Crypto.com, and FTX in the USA are spending heavily on direct advertising and sign-on promotions to end-user investors. Whatever you can share about your estimations of the brokers and CEXs that would be in the initial waves of joining Yellow, e.g. name, region of world and estimated user base, etc. would be helpful in understanding the initial rollout and growth prospects for Yellow
  * The table above is combining our existing customers and inbound opportunities with respective churn rate. Each Broker has on average access to 100,000 traders in their respective regions.
  * Example: A candidate of our incubator is integrating their widget to buy crypto into a major Brazilian online bank counting 9 million of users.
* What sort of guarantees on transaction ordering costs and exchange API settlement latency do you think that arbitrators will get on the Yellow mesh network? How does this line up with your expectation of what arbitrators will need to find Yellow.com compelling
  * Yellow Network has been focused only on Financial information exchange while letting custodians participate. Yellow Network offers an accounting mechanism to combine custodians and leverage their instant settlement capabilities.
  * From the Arbitrator's point of view, there is no benefit of moving the assets out of the underlying custodians, while they earn by continuous low-cost trading.

#### Tokenomics / Finance[​](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/FAQ#tokenomics--finance) <a href="#_v3so2x5bg1wo" id="_v3so2x5bg1wo"></a>

* Have you worked with an advisor for tokenomics? If yes, which one?
  * Yes we have worked with several advisors with high credibility in the industry. [https://www.linkedin.com/in/juergenhoebarth/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juergenhoebarth/)
  * [https://www.linkedin.com/in/joterovila/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joterovila/)
* What benefits do token holders get?
  * Ability to stake YELLOW token to run a node
  * Ability to stake token for liquidity mining (collecting fees going through the channel)
  * DAO possible depending on US regulations (DAO risks qualifying the token to security, which we don’t mind, but security token can’t be listed on most CEX, so it's really a gray area these days).
  * Social activity such as influencing articles and projects on yellow.com launchpad.
  * Paying fees for liquidity, and reducing these fees by the amount of YELLOW tokens held.
* Do you have plans to move to the DAO model (as a community driven model)?
  * Yes. Community funds and 55% of the tokens are DAO driven.
* How does your company treasury work?
  * Company treasury is created for the expansion of any group related companies, but it will most likely be inter-company loans, as those tokens are on the Seychelles balance sheet.
* How do you plan to manage the conflict of interest between equity & tokens holders as not all the IP will be open source?
  * Tokens are a product of the company. So the equity shareholders see it on the balance sheet and inventory. With the proper structure, they complement each other.
  * For the software we are likely going to open-source everything.
* Trade mining rewards: what happens when the 10% have been distributed? Is it just to boost acquisition and liquidity at the beginning?
  * Similar to bitcoin rewards, trading mining only brings the fees, but no additional rewards.
* What are your mechanics for influencing the price?
  * Limited supply, Stake/Lock of token (de-Staking is not instant), burning social interaction tokens, (50% of votes). For the later, Yellow.com will provide a lot of side services with a social network, DAO, Launchpad, CoinStats, DeFi, the main loyalty is by social interactions.
* How is the project currently financed? What is the current burn rate?
  * Our income comes from the software licenses, and Market making.
  * Total costs are 300k$/month but we are breakeven, so we can say almost 0$ burn rate.
  * Last year we have re-allocated all of the staff on Yellow Network, which might have incurred minor losses.

#### Product / Architecture[​](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/FAQ#product--architecture) <a href="#_dy85d5gcnnyw" id="_dy85d5gcnnyw"></a>

* Why choose a state channel among the scaling solutions? instead of side-chains or rollups?
  * State-channels are faster, not limited to a single side-chains, they also enable cross-chain trading. Mostly for scaling to billions, (think of 100 DyDx scale with high frequency trading on 2,000 trading pairs spot and futures.
* For example, do you envision the super low latency and high scaling of state channels to also be able to support DeFi primitives like AMMs in Curve, Balancer, perpetuals, etc.?
  * State-Channels are so efficient in cost, that it seems the only way to connect all DeFi products and leverage their properties.State-Channels allow us to form a technology-agnostic overlay network making it much cheaper and safer to reach new chains, networks and liquidity pools.
  * We offer a simple SDK which most developers can use to connect their DeFi products. The strategy is crowd-sourcing the liquidity.
* “Liquidity providers take share of profits from trading fees”, everything happening on-chain? How do you manage that with state channels?
  * Funding, opening a state-channels is on-chain. Trading is performed off-chain (both local trades on Broker’s node and P2P-trades). A Broker deposits a collateral and yellow token, so they can then exchange the liquidity, and the provider collects the fees.
* What other layer 1s are you connected to or planning to connect?
  * We plan to connect to every Layer-1,2 bridges, wallets, bank, exchange. The partners are in queue for the software development where our engineer builds the connectors, then we make a joint press release.
* How is the challenge/judge mechanism of Yellow Network's state channel designed?
  *
    1. Watch tower is auditing transactions between brokers and manages disputes automatically.
* How do Finex nodes sync prices? Will there be a price difference between nodes? Do all Finex nodes share the same liquidity depth? Can Finex node run as standalone mode?
  *
    1. P2P broadcast using a PubSub, a market is a Topic. There can be price difference between nodes. Depending on how many peers this node has, it has a more or less complete Order Book. (Think torrent discovery of node)
  * All finex node can show same depth, how deep they can go depends on their state-channels collateral.
  * Finex node can run in stand-alone with non-network Orderbook.
* Is the Finex network based on blockchain architecture or other distributed architecture?
  * Using LibP2P (think ipfs) it's a new network with gateways being state-channels Smart-Contracts on each Layer1,2
* If the Finex network crashes, how to ensure the security of user assets based on this architecture?
  * Users asset are on a smart contract custody, a crash would not affect them, they can withdraw their fund even if broker never come back.
* OpenFinance uses Custody to host user assets. If users deposit assets into this contract, if the L3 state channel crashes, how can users withdraw their assets?
  * They can withdraw by calling the method from metamask.
* Can you elaborate on Cross-chain settlements?
  * An “Adjudicator” is a smart-contract which collects and releases funds for a state-channel, it is possible to design Adjudicators which have 2 or more smart-contracts for custody, which means it can open a channel between brokers from different networks.
* Can you elaborate on Dispute Resolution?
  * Dispute occurs in the case brokers do not agree on the final balance, this is most often due to network issues, or malicious broker cases. In our case, we have KYB, registered and sometimes regulated businesses, so in the initial phase we sort those issues by arbitration.Later we introduce the concept of “Watch Tower” which is a neutral party software auditing the channels. similarly to a soccer referee. Which allows automatic-dispute resolution

#### Traction / Development Stage[​](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/FAQ#traction--development-stage) <a href="#_kcm70uhbygx4" id="_kcm70uhbygx4"></a>

* Is Yellow.com currently running as a CEX, or has L3(Yellow Network) been implemented?
  * Yellow.com is running OpenDAX V3; it uses our liquidity network v1 called XLN.
* When I use Yellow.com to deposit ETH, an ETH address is generated on the deposit page. If I deposit ETH to this address, what will happen later? When will the deposit amount appear on the assets page?
  * Better you try alpha.yellow.org
* Peatio is a previous generation of CEX software that has not been maintained for 6 years. During your developing process, which features did you keep, which removed, which added?
  * We are the main maintainers of Peatio, in the past 4 years we have released versions 1, 2, 3, currently we still maintain v3.1, however the architecture has completely changed comparing to old Peatio from 2015
