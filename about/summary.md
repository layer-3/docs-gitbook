# ðŸ“Œ Summary

As blockchain technology evolves, so does the complexity and the variety of solutions.&#x20;

At Yellow Network we are committed to making cryptocurrency trading lean, efficient, and secure.&#x20;

A large amount of blockchains, tokens, and platforms has led to a silo approach that confronts users with inefficiencies and security issues, hindering scalability and mass adoption.&#x20;

Yellow Network aims to address this issue with a P2P network that uses state channels to connect brokers across blockchains, allowing it to reach tokens locked in isolated networks without cross-chain bridging.

The matching throughput of our network averages billions of messages daily, far quicker than any Layer-1 or Layer-2 solution currently available. Our solution is an automated smart clearing protocol, comparable to the function of a clearing house in traditional finance. Yellow Network acts as a mediator between brokers, exchanges, and market makers. It provides users with a protocol that works worldwide. It offers an all-in-one Web3 solution ready for the global retail market, a real-time inter-broker exchange, near-instant off-chain transactions, and efficient on-chain transactions.

By decoupling trading and settlement, the Yellow Network protocol enables true decentralization of high-frequency trading and widens access to digital and traditional assets.
