Yellow Network stands at the crossroads between traditional financial markets and Web3.&#x20;

While the underlying technology and the focus of Yellow Network are deeply embedded in the world of blockchain and Web 3, we seek to resolve a matter that has its root in traditional finance and trade.&#x20;

Yellow Network aims to bring the concept of a traditional clearing house into the Web 3 space. To understand our approach and the challenges we face, it is essential to be familiar with related work done in both areas, Web3, and traditional finance.&#x20;
