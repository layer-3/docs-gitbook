{% hint style="info" %}
Yellow Network is a project in development. Not all solutions presented in the following (sub)sections are implemented at this stage. The current, and all subsequent sub-pages, are subject to change.

Yellow Network is a non-profit project that seeks to solve the problem of truly decentralized trading by allowing participants to swap assets across different exchanges without having to rely on block creation. This brings all parties, exchanges, blockchains, and trading firms together, creating a network of brokerages and allowing for a more efficient trading infrastructure.

_**Our global strategy is to have 1,000+ participants operating globally on the network by 2025.**_

## Sustainable Token Ecosystem

Our [$YELLOW](../yellow-network/usdyellow/tokenomics.md) token serves as the gateway to Yellow Network. Participants of Yellow Network are required to lock $YELLOW in order to open trading channels with other brokers.&#x20;

$YELLOW token margin accounts ensure accountability and prevent overexposure, thus significantly reducing counterparty risk when accessing non-proprietary assets.&#x20;

Yellow Network is a non-profit organization where market makers earn 100% of the liquidity provisioning fees. Our P2P technology allows brokers to define the [fees ](../yellow-network/fees/)at their discretion, creating unprecedented fee transparency.&#x20;

Yellow Network only charges a small settlement fee to users to fund the [Yellow Reserve Vault](../yellow-network/yellow-reserve-vault.md) which serves to resolve settlement disputes and acts as a treasury for the Yellow Network ecosystem. With this approach, every participant contributes to safety and security.
