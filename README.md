# Introduction

Since Bitcoin and Binance, many engineers and traders work together in crypto. While most traders only use CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the trading occurs in isolated silos, each CEX and DEX (Decentralized Exchange) has its own list of markets and unlike traditional finance those markets are not global.

Blockchain has brought decentralized computation, but it's far from being able scale to what traditional finance is today, due to the consensus algorithm which requires nodes to agree on the version of the state.
