# Introduction

Since Bitcoin and Binance, many engineers and traders work together in crypto. While most traders only use CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the trading occurs in isolated silos, each CEX and DEX (Decentralized Exchange) has its own list of markets and unlike traditional finance, those markets are not global.

Blockchain has brought decentralized computation, but it's far from being able to scale to what traditional finance is today, due to the consensus algorithm which requires nodes to agree on the version of the state.

The Bitcoin network solved the problem of one-way decentralized payments.

The Yellow Network solves the problem of truly decentralized trading by swapping the assets of participants across different exchanges.

Our aim is to have real decentralized trading, bringing all of today’s parties—exchanges, blockchains, and trading firms— together to allow the creation of a network of brokerages for more efficient trading infrastructure.

Yellow Network embodies a decentralized Layer-3 peer-to-peer mesh exchange network used for communicating and trading between brokers and aggregating liquidity of connected nodes.

Powered by state channel technology, it enables ultra-high-performance settlement between brokers on top of a blockchain. This solution also enables cross-chain trading without the need to bridge tokens.
