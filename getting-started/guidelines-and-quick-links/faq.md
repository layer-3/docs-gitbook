### Company <a href="#_ybf38mwqeoqh" id="_ybf38mwqeoqh"></a>

#### About Yellow Companies Group[​](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/introduction#yellow-group) <a href="#_ybf38mwqeoqh" id="_ybf38mwqeoqh"></a>

Yellow is an umbrella brand, representing a conglomerate of fintech and blockchain product companies.

Contributors to this project within the Yellow ecosystem are Openware (technology—OpenDAX™), Assetum (market-making), Yellow Capital (incubates and leads), and Attirer (crypto marketing services).

We combine the multi-year crypto software development experience of Openware and Yellow’s success in running a crypto exchange. This multi-structural practice allowed us to inspect numerous potential bottlenecks on both sides.

Yellow Network is powered by Openware’s software, OpenDAX™. While OpenDAX™ brokerage software is free, connecting the node to liquidity streams (channels) requires staking the $YELLOW token—starting from 250,000 for four channels.

We offer optional enterprise-grade support for node runners which is $240,000 per year.

Moreover, the Openware partner network will ensure the adoption and integration of new and operating CEXs and DEXs to Yellow Network.

Assetum is a market-making company that contributes to the project’s liquidity via the widespread network of partnerships. Yellow Connect brings new exciting Blockchain solutions and crypto projects through Yellow Incubator to ensure their native integration into the ecosystem.

### Business Model

❓ What is the expected gross revenue ratio from HFT trading activities vs. retail trading?



| **Year**                 | **2022** | **2023** | **2024** | **2025** |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Active nodes             | 185      | 385      | 585      | 845      |
| Number of active brokers | 37       | 77       | 117      | 164      |
| Est. HFT Gross revenue   | $51M     | $230M    | $552M    | $1,064M  |
| Est. Total Gross revenue | $63M     | $254M    | $600M    | $1,157M  |

**❓ How do you plan to increase the number of brokers during the years ahead?**

We currently have a number of brokers in the alpha testing of the network.

Every month, we receive around 160 new customer inquiries about creating their brokerage.

Also, we have about 20 partner distributors who have their own stream of customers. They can install the application that is activated when they stake enough $YELLOW tokens.

**❓ How do you plan to share revenues with Yellow Network users? Where do the fees go?**

To collect fees, you must run a Yellow node and mine trades. You can create liquidity channels and charge the traffic for using it. Your collateral on this state channel is used to enable the network to reach more liquidity, thus collecting a fee from the volume in it.

**❓ What is your way of calculating the Projected Market Cap?**

Using the NASDAQ algorithm, we calculated it at 20 times the annual revenues of all connected brokers. It is usual for crypto startups to reach 100 times the annual revenues.

**❓ How is the Network Combined Revenue calculated? What are the hypothetical values for trading fees?**

The Network Combined Revenue is calculated based on the revenue of all brokers of the network. The trading fees will range from 0.1 to 0.15%.

### Tokenomics/Finance

**❓ Have you worked with any Tokenomics advisor? If yes, which one?**

Besides our in-house experts, we are delighted to have various reputable Tokenomics Advisors such as [**Juergen Hoebarth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juergenhoebarth/) and [**Juan Otero**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joterovila/) supporting our project.

**❓ Total supply of 10 billion tokens is the hard cap. Is that correct?**

Yes, correct.

**❓ What benefits do YELLOW token holders get?**

* Ability to stake $YELLOW tokens to run a node
* Ability to stake tokens for liquidity mining (collecting fees going through the channel)
* DAO is possible depending on US regulations (DAO risks linking the tokens to security, which is not a bad thing in itself, but security tokens can’t be listed on most CEXs. At the moment this is a really a gray area.)
* Social activity such as influencing articles and projects on the [yellow.com](http://yellow.com) launchpad
* Paying fees for liquidity, and reducing these fees by the number of $YELLOW tokens in hold.

**❓ Do you have plans to move to the DAO model (as a community-driven model)?**

Yes. Community funds and 55% of the tokens are DAO-driven.

&#x20;**❓ How does your company treasury work?**

The company treasury was created to expand any group-related company, but it will most likely be via inter-company loans, as those tokens are on the Seychelles balance sheet.

**❓ Trade mining rewards: what happens when the 10% have been distributed? Is it just to boost acquisition and liquidity at the beginning?**

Similar to bitcoin rewards, trade mining only brings the fees, but no additional rewards.

**❓ What entity will sell the tokens?**

[Layer-3 Foundation](https://www.layer3.foundation/).

### Product / Architecture

**❓ Why did you choose a state channel technology among other scaling solutions? Why not side-chains or rollups?**

State channels are faster, not limited to single side-chains. They also enable cross-chain trading. Mostly for scaling to billions, think of 100 DyDx scale with high-frequency trading on 2,000 trading pairs spot and futures.

**❓ “Liquidity providers take a share of profits from trading fees.”—Is everything happening on-chain? How do you manage that with state channels?**

Funding and opening state channels is on-chain. Trading is performed off-chain (both local trades on brokers' nodes and P2P trades.) Brokers deposit collateral and $YELLOW tokens, so they can exchange the liquidity then, and the provider collects the fees.

**❓ What Layer-1s are you connected to and planning to connect to?**

We plan to connect to every Layer-1, and 2: bridges, wallets, bank, exchange. Partners are in a queue for the software development while our engineer builds the connectors, then we will make a joint press release.

**❓ How do Finex nodes sync prices? Will there be a price difference between nodes? Do all Finex nodes share the same liquidity depth? Can the Finex node run as a standalone mode?**

Finex synchronization is via P2P broadcast using a PubSub; a market is a Topic. There can be price differences between nodes. Depending on how many peers this node has, it has a more or less complete order book. (Think torrent discovery of Node.)

All Finex nodes can show the same depth; how deep they go depends on their state channel collateral.

Finex nodes can run as a stand-alone with non-network order books.

&#x20;**❓ Is the Finex network based on blockchain architecture or other distributed architecture?**

Using LibP2P (think IPFS); this is a new network with gateways being state channels' smart contracts on each Layer-1 and Layer-2.

&#x20;**❓ If the Finex network crashes, how will you ensure the security of users’ assets based on this architecture?**

Users’ assets are in the smart contract custody. A crash would not affect them; users could withdraw their funds even if the broker never comes back.

**❓ OpenFinance uses custody to host user assets. If users deposit assets into this contract and the L3 state channel crashes, how can users withdraw their assets?**

They can withdraw via MetaMask's withdrawal procedure.

**❓ Can you elaborate on cross-chain settlements?**

An “Adjudicator” is a smart contract that collects and releases funds for a state channel. It can be designed with two or more smart contracts for custody, which means it can open a channel between brokers from different networks.

**❓ Can you elaborate on Dispute Resolution?**

A dispute occurs when brokers do not agree on the final balance. This is most often due to network issues or malicious broker cases. In our case, we have KYB, registered, and sometimes regulated businesses, so we sort those issues through arbitration in the initial phase.

We plan to introduce the concept of "Watch Tower," a neutral party software that audits the channels and allows automatic dispute resolution.

**❓ How is the challenge/judge mechanism of Yellow Network's state channel designed?**

Watch Tower audits transactions between brokers and manages disputes automatically.
