# üê§ Duckies, Yellow's Canary Network

Duckies as Yellow‚Äôs Canary Network tests the innovations of Yellow Network in a real-world environment, including the latest versions of smart contracts and software components.

Duckies Network will be used for trading tangible assets like on the production Yellow Network, but with smaller transaction value. It minimizes the risk of releasing vulnerabilities while risking small amounts of money. The $DUCKIES token is the token used on Duckies to connect to the network and pay the fees, acting like the $YELLOW token for Yellow Network.
