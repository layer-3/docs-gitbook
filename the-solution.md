### Security&#x20;

It is ensured by dividing responsibilities between custodians, brokers, and exchanges.

The solution is hardware and software wallet-based and non-custodial, unlike most CEXs currently available on the crypto market. This deals with many users’ safety concerns and significantly decreases the possibility of hacks within Yellow Network. Phasing out of controllable hot wallets is a big step towards full transparency of crypto finance for the end-user.

The security of the users’ funds is also ensured by Yellow Network. Each broker has to put the necessary amount of collateral funds in $YELLOW tokens to operate on the network. If any fraud or malicious activity that may affect users is detected on the broker's side, the dispute system will immediately return the user's assets.

#### **For Brokers**

Today we see hacks everywhere, and we constantly witness how various bottlenecks and flaws lead to huge token steals. State channel technology proves effective to fight this dangerous trend. The funds belong to either a state channel or the user's wallet. On both sides, it is impossible to break into the wallet without the secure private key or avoid two-side confirmation for the final status update on the state channel.
