### Security&#x20;

It is ensured by dividing responsibilities between custodians, brokers, and exchanges.

The solution is hardware and software wallet-based and non-custodial. Unlike most CEXs currently available on the crypto market, it deals with many users' safety concerns and significantly decreases the possibility of hacks within Yellow Network. Phasing out of controllable hot wallets is a big step towards the complete transparency of cryptocurrency finance for the end-user.

Yellow Network also ensures the security of the users' funds by having each broker put the necessary amount of collateral funds in $YELLOW tokens to operate on the network. If any fraud or malicious activity that may affect users is detected on the broker's side, the dispute system will immediately return the user's assets.

#### **For Brokers**

Today we see hacks occurring everywhere, and we constantly witness how various bottlenecks and flaws lead to huge token steals. State channel technology proves effective in fighting this dangerous trend. The funds belong to either a state channel or the user's wallet. On both sides, it is impossible to break into the wallet without the secure private key or avoid two-side confirmation for the final status update on the state channel.

#### For End-Users&#x20;

Yellow Network is non-custodial; end-users can deposit funds to the smart contract with a hard/software wallet; this resolves major end-users concerns about improper funds storage and the safety of their assets.&#x20;

The security of the end-users funds is also ensured by the amount of collateral funds locked with Yellow tokens. As soon as any fraud or malicious activity affecting end-users funds is detected on the broker's side - the dispute system will ensure the return of assets to their rightful owners.
