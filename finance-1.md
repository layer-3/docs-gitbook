**ECN facilitates access to brokers to global financial markets; Yellow network protocol forms a decentralized ECN for digital assets.**

### Clearing house

A clearing house is a financial institution formed to facilitate the exchange securities, commodities or derivatives transactions. The clearing house stands between two broker firms to reduce the risk of a member firm failing to honor its trade settlement obligations.

In acting as a middleman, the clearinghouse provides the security and efficiency that is integral to stability in a financial market.

**Facilitates cross brokerage transactions; Yellow Network brings this functionality using state channel technology and settlement using a smart contract.**
