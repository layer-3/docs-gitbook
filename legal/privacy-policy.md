Thank you for visiting [https://www.yellow.org/](https://www.yellow.org/) (**"Website"**)&#x20;

The Website is owned and operated by Layer3 FinTech Ltd. and its affiliates (together **"Operator"**, **"we"**, **"our"**, or **"us"**).

This Privacy Policy (**"Privacy Policy"**) sets out the basis on which any Personal Data we collect from you (**"you"** or **"your"**), or that you provide to us, will be processed.

Please read the following carefully to understand what data we collect, how that data is used and how it can be shared by us. If you do not wish for your Personal Data to be used in the ways described within this Privacy Policy then you should not access or use the Website or use the services, functions, or features offered from time to time on the Website.

### 1. What information do we collect?

#### **1.1. Personal Data**

Personal data or personal information means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. It does not include data which cannot be used to identify an individual person, such as a company registration number. A ‚Äúdata subject‚Äù is an individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by personal data. This is usually by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, email address, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Different pieces of information which are collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person and also constitute personal data. It does not include data where the identity has been removed and this data is no longer capable of identifying an individual (‚ÄúAnonymous Data‚Äù).

#### **1.2. Information that you provide**

This is information about you that you give us by (i) registering for an account; (ii) using the Support Center on the Website; or (iii) corresponding with us by phone, email, or otherwise.

#### **1.3. Information we may collect about you**

Every time you use the Services, we may collect the following information, which may be considered to be Personal Data when combined with other information:

### 6. International Transfers

#### **6.1. International Transfer of Personal Data**

Personal Data and other data may therefore be exported outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside. Your Personal Data may be processed and stored in a foreign country or countries. Under those circumstances, the governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country or those countries may be able to obtain access to your Personal Data through foreign laws. You need to be aware that the privacy standards of those countries may be lower than those of the jurisdiction in which you reside.

#### **6.2. No Guarantee**

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. While we do our utmost to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us over email or through the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

### 7. Your Privacy Rights

#### **7.1. Access**

You may access and verify your Personal Data held by the Operator by submitting a written request using our Support Center.

You may request us to rectify or update any of your personal information held by us that is inaccurate. You may do this at any time by logging in to your account and updating your profile information.

#### **7.3. Withdraw consent**

To the extent that the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the Operator‚Äôs processing based on consent before your withdrawal.

#### **7.4. Erasure**

You may request to erase your Personal Data, subject to applicable law. If you close your account, we will mark your account in our database as closed but will keep certain account information, including your request to erase it, in our database for a period of time. This is necessary to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account and complying with our legal obligations. However, if you close your account, your personal information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

#### **7.5. Restriction of processing**

In some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to restrict or object to our processing or transferring your personal information under certain circumstances. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the **defense** of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.

#### **7.6. Marketing communications**

If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can also let us know via the methods stated below. The electronic marketing communications we send to you also contain opt-out mechanisms that allow you to opt-out from receiving those communications, update your contact information or change your preferences at any time. We will honor your choice and refrain from sending you such announcements. You may also opt back in to receive those communications at any time.

### 8. Other Websites and protecting your Personal Data

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for or able to control, the privacy, security, or other practices of any third parties. It is your responsibility to review the privacy statements, policies, terms, and conditions of any person or company to whom you choose to link or with whom you choose to contract. The Operator is not responsible for the privacy statements, policies, terms, conditions, or other content of any Website not owned or managed by the Operator.

#### **8.2. Your obligation to protect Personal Data**

The Operator takes all reasonable efforts to protect and safeguard Personal Data, but there are protective measures you should take as well. Do not share your Personal Data with others unless you clearly understand the purpose of their request for it and you know with whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive Personal Data in your email inbox. If you are asked to assign passwords to connect you to your Personal Data, you should use a secure password and always use two-factor authentication (2FA), where available. You should change your password regularly.
