# Smart Clearing Protocol

### Network access

To join the Yellow Network, the broker needs to stake a minimum amount of 250,000 $YELLOW tokens. This allows him to create 4 peer-to-peer trading channels and access the liquidity pool of those 4 peers.

Sample bellow:&#x20;

| $YELLOW token staked | Opened state channels |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| 250.000              | 4                     |
