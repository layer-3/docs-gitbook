{% hint style="info" %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Fee Structure (1).png>)

Yellow Network charges fees and rewards participants based on their activity. However, fees are not charged for profit; all collected fees are either redistributed to network participants or used to fund the [Reserve Vault](../yellow-reserve-vault.md).

Brokers using Yellow Network will encounter two fee layers.

The first layer is a **Liquidity (or Trading) Fee** directly negotiated between the brokers to incentivize market-making and liquidity provisioning within Yellow Network. This fee is directly exchanged between the Market Maker and the Market Taker.&#x20;

The [second layer](clearing-fee.md) is a **Clearing Fee,** the only fee Yellow Network charges for both sides of a trade. The clearing fee is sent to the [Yellow Reserve Vault](../yellow-reserve-vault.md), which provides treasury and dispute resolution functions, supporting the $YELLOW token.
