{% hint style="info" %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Fee Structure (1).png>)

Yellow Network will charge fees and reward participants based on their activity. However, fees are not charged for profit; all collected fees are either redistributed to network participants or used to fund the [Reserve Vault](../yellow-reserve-vault.md).

Brokers using Yellow Network will encounter two fee layers.

The first layer [(Layer 1)](layer-1-liquidity-fee.md) is a **Liquidity Fee** directly negotiated between the brokers to incentivize market making and liquidity provisioning within Yellow Network. This fee is directly exchanged between the Market Maker and the Market Taker.&#x20;

The second layer [(Layer 2)](layer-2-clearing-fee.md) is a **Clearing Fee** for both sides of a trade. The clearing fee is sent to the [Yellow Reserve Vault](../yellow-reserve-vault.md) which provides treasury and dispute resolution functions, supporting the $YELLOW token price and providing our token a simple yet effective use case.
