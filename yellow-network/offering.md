## Security&#x20;

Security is ensured by dividing responsibilities between custodians, brokers, and exchanges.

Our solution is hardware and software wallet-based and non-custodial. Unlike most CEXs, this resolves users' safety concerns and significantly decreases the possibility of attacks on Yellow Network. Phasing out controllable hot wallets is a big step towards transparency for the end-user.

Yellow Network also ensures the security of the users' funds by requiring each broker to deposit collateral in the form of $YELLOW tokens to operate on the network. Any fraud or malicious activity that may affect users is detected on the broker's side; the dispute system will immediately return the user's assets, thus preventing fraudulent transactions.

### **For Brokers**

Today, we see hacks occurring everywhere and witness how various bottlenecks and flaws lead to huge token steals. State channel technology proves effective in fighting this dangerous trend. The funds belong to either a state channel or the user's wallet. On both sides, it is impossible to break into the wallet without the secure private key or avoid two-sided confirmation for the final status update on the state channel.

### For End-Users&#x20;

Yellow Network is non-custodial. End-users deposit funds to the smart contract through their personal hard/software wallet. This resolves major end-user concerns about the improper storage of funds and the safety of their assets.&#x20;

The security of the end-users' funds is also ensured by the amount of collateral that brokers have to deposit before opening a trading channel. As soon as any fraud or malicious activity is detected on the state channel, the dispute system will ensure the return of assets to their rightful owners.
