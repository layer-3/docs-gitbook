* **Max Supply:** 10,000,000,000

## **Token Utility**[**â€‹**](https://www.yellow.org/docs/litepaper/yellow-token#token-usage)

We are committed to giving our token simple yet effective utility right out of the gate. Over time we intend to broaden the use of $YELLOW with our partners and more.&#x20;



### âž¤ Paying blockchain TX fees

On the Yellow network, every participant is identified using a Yellow Smart Account (YSA), which implements ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction). When a user submits a blockchain transaction through his Yellow account, fees are paid in YELLOW tokens using a Paymaster. The YSA allows posting TX across multiple chains and supports WalletConnect.

### âž¤ Network Access

Our token is the key to accessing Yellow Network. Brokers are required to lock $YELLOW tokens as collateral and, in turn, get the ability to open trading channels.

Network participants must meet the lock requirements set by their counterparts, and this safety deposit can be slashed if one of the parties misses a settlement in the Time-to-settle (TTS).

Tokens collected from the penalty are collected into the **Yellow Reserve Vault**.

### âž¤ Clearing fees

When two participants execute a batch settlement, both sides pay a clearing fee on the USD evaluation of the settlement size (for example, 1% on each side of $20,000 worth of assets swapped).

This Clearing fee is also an incentive to optimize the size of batching. Clearing fees are collected and locked into the Yellow Community Vault.

### âž¤ Yellow Community Vault

The Yellow Reserve Vault or (Yellow Community Vault) is our concept of a treasury to secure Yellow Network. As the network is growing so will the Reserve Vault, providing security and comfort to all participants.&#x20;
