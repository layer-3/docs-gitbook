# Fee Structure

The Yellow Clearing House will charge fees and reward participants based on their activity within the Yellow Network. The Yellow Network will not charge fees for profit; all collected fees are either redistributed or used for token liquidity management.

Brokers using the Yellow Network will encounter two fee layers.

The first layer is a **Liquidity Fee** directly negotiated between the brokers to incentivize market-making and liquidity provisioning within the Yellow Network.

The second layer is a **Clearing Fee** for both sides of a trade. The clearing fee is sent to the Yellow Reserve Vault that provides treasury and burning functions, supporting the $YELLOW token price and providing our native token a simple yet effective use case.
