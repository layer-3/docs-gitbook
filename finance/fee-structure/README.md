# Fee Structure

**The Yellow Clearing House will charge fees and reward participants based on their activity within the Yellow Network. The Yellow Network will not charge fees for profit; all collected fees are either redistributed or used for token liquidity management.**

Brokers using the Yellow Network will encounter two fee layers.

The first layer is a **Liquidity** **Fee** directly negotiated between the brokers to incentivize market-making and liquidity provisioning within the Yellow Network.

The second layer is a C**learing Fee** for both sides of a trade and applies whenever a transaction between two brokers is settled. The clearing fee is sent to _the Yellow Reserve Vault_ which is tasked with the $YELLOW token governance, providing our native token a simple yet effective use case.
