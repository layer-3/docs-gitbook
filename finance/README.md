Yellow is an overlay mesh network that uses state channels to unify all of the blockchains. This is not a new blockchain.

It is a financial transaction processing framework built on top of blockchains.

We use state channel technology to make metadata index over the liquidity and digital asset over any blockchain, making trading easier.

The highlighted benefits of this approach are being global, localized, and ultra-high-speed because since there is no blockchain, there are no typical performance bottlenecks.
