# Fee Calculation Example

#### Pre-Defined parameters (Assumptions)

* Liquidity Fee is charged at the end of each clearing cycle
* Clearing Fee is charged periodically at the end of each month
* Broker Fee; 0.01% (Floor)&#x20;
* Price BTC/USDT 20.000&#x20;
* Price $YELLOW/USDT 10

#### Broker A&#x20;

* Acts as Market Maker&#x20;
* 4 open State Channels = 1.00% Clearing Fee&#x20;
* No additional Fee on B2B level, i.e. use of Market Taker Floor Fee

Liquidity Fee: None, Broker A is Market Maker and thus will receive 100% of the Liquidity Fee generated by Broker B

Clearing/Settlement Fee: 200.000 USDT x 1% / 10 = 200 $YELLOW

#### Broker B&#x20;

* Acts as Market Taker&#x20;
* 8 open State Channels = 0.80% Clearing Fee&#x20;
* No additional Fee on B2B level, i.e. use of Market Taker Floor Fee Buys 10 BTC vs. USDT @ $20k

Liquidity Fee: 10 BTC x 20.000 x 0.01% = 20 USDT

Clearing/Settlement Fee: 200.000 USDT x 0.80% / 10 = 160 $YELLOW
