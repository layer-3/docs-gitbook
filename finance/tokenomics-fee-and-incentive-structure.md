# Tokenomics, Fee and Incentive Structure

The Yellow Clearing House will charge fees and reward participants based on their activity within the Yellow Network.

Fees and rewards will be calculated and charged/credited from/to the broker's “operating collateral” wallet as defined under the [Economics ](../business-model/economics.md)section.

The Yellow Network will have two layers of Fees. The Yellow Network will not charge fees for profit and all collected fees will be used for redistribution and token liquidity management;

**Layer 1** is a fee charged to Market Takers for using another brokers liquidity. This fee is redistributed to incentivize Market Makers, burn Yellow Tokens and build a Yellow Network Treasury.

**Layer 2** is a clearing fee, charged upon clearing of open positions between brokers and converted to Yellow Tokens. The fee is redistributed to Yellow Network participants and to support the Yellow Treasury.
