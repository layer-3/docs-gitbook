# Yellow Reserve Vault

The Yellow Reserve Vault is our treasury entity and is tasked with two main responsibilities;

1. To provide stability for the $YELLOW token
2. Building a diversified currency reserve to resolve settlement disputes between brokers.

$YELLOW Tokens sent to the reserve vault will be used to build a diversified portfolio of tokens and coins. Holding a diversified portfolio reduces market risk while at the same time enabling the vault to have a variety of currencies to settle disputes.

The Reserve Vault can decide to burn $YELLOW under certain conditions to support the valuation of the native Yellow Network token.
