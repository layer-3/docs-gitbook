# Smart Clearing House

A clearing house is a financial institution formed to facilitate the exchange securities, commodities, or derivatives transactions. The clearing house stands between two broker firms to reduce the risk of a member firm failing to honor its trade settlement obligations.

The clearing house enters the picture after a buyer and a seller execute a trade. Its role is to accomplish the steps that finalize, and therefore validate, the transaction. In acting as a middleman, the clearinghouse provides the security and efficiency that is integral to stability in a financial market.
