# Electronic Communication Network

Yellow implements a mesh and decentralized ECN.

An electronic communication network (ECN) is a computerized system that automatically matches buy and sell orders for securities in the market. ECN trading is especially helpful when investors in different geographic areas wish to complete a secure transaction without the use of a third party.

The ECN aggregates books of brokers and market makers in different locations. This leads to deeper liquidity and larger orderbooks and thus a tighter bid-ask spread and faster order execution. Traders can get more attractive spreads and better order flow.&#x20;

An additional benefit of The ECN's order aggregation is better price transparency for all participating brokers and market makers.&#x20;

Using an ECN counters market fragmentation issue, while maintaining the decentralization aspect of the crypto trading market.&#x20;
