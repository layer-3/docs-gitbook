# Electronic Communication Network

Yellow implements a mesh and decentralized ECN.

An electronic communication network (ECN) is a computerized system that automatically matches buy and sell orders for securities in the market. ECN trading is especially helpful when investors in different geographic areas wish to complete a secure transaction without the use of a third party.

The ECN taps into the aggregation of brokers and market makers in different locations. Deeper liquidity will lead to more liquidity and larger orderbooks. This in turn leads to more attractive spreads and better order flow.&#x20;

It thus counters fragmentation while at the same time maintain decentralization of the crypto trading market.&#x20;
